❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior as
the function relies on variables from the outer scope (which might not always be available or have the expected values).
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and tightly coupled to specific variables.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ **Explicit Parameters:** The function now explicitly accepts `a` and `b` as parameters. This makes the function
self-contained and predictable.
* ✔️ **Clear Scope:** The function now operates on values passed to it, avoiding reliance on external variables.
* ✔️ **Reusability:** The function can now be used with any two numbers, making it much more versatile.

Example Usage:

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
console.log(result);
```

Final Note:

Always aim to write functions that are independent and operate on their inputs. This enhances reusability, testability,
and reduces the risk of unexpected side effects.
